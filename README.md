# Retail Sales Analysis and Demand Forecasting with Walmart Data

## Project Overview

Walmart, one of the largest retailers in the United States, plans to improve its sales and demand forecasting capabilities. This study uses historical sales data from 45 Walmart shops to create machine learning models that effectively estimate sales and demand while accounting for a variety of economic factors and events.
Accurate demand forecasting is critical for Walmart to effectively manage inventory, particularly during holidays and promotional events. This research addresses difficulties such as unforeseen demand and stockouts by developing powerful predictive models that take into account economic variables such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Unemployment Index, and the cost of fuel.

## Dataset Description
The historical sales data spans from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01 and includes the following fields:

   Store: Store number
   Date: Week of sales
   Weekly_Sales: Sales for the given store
   Holiday_Flag: Indicator of a special holiday week (1 – Holiday week, 0 – Non-holiday week)
   Temperature: Temperature on the day of sale
   Fuel_Price: Cost of fuel in the region
   CPI: Prevailing Consumer Price Index
   Unemployment: Prevailing unemployment rate
   
Holiday Events:

   Super Bowl: 12-Feb-10, 11-Feb-11, 10-Feb-12, 8-Feb-13
   Labour Day: 10-Sep-10, 9-Sep-11, 7-Sep-12, 6-Sep-13
   Thanksgiving: 26-Nov-10, 25-Nov-11, 23-Nov-12, 29-Nov-13
   Christmas: 31-Dec-10, 30-Dec-11, 28-Dec-12, 27-Dec-13

## Analysis Tasks
#### Basic Statistics:
  1. Identify the Store with Maximum Sales
     
  2. Determine the Store with Maximum Sales Variability
     Calculate the standard deviation of sales
     
     Compute the coefficient of variation (mean to standard deviation ratio)
     
  3. Assess Quarterly Growth Rate for Q3 2012
     
  4. Analyze Holiday Impact on Sales
     Compare holiday sales to mean non-holiday sales across all stores
     
  5. Provide Monthly and Semester Sales Insights


## Steps to Run the Project
Data Preparation:
Load the Walmart_Store_sales dataset.

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize sales trends across different stores and time periods.

Analyze the impact of holidays on sales.

Statistical Analysis:
Compute basic statistics to identify trends and insights.

Perform time series analysis for quarterly and monthly trends.

Model Building:
Develop linear regression models to predict sales.

Evaluate the impact of economic factors (CPI, unemployment, fuel price) on sales.

Transform dates for sequential analysis and create new variables.

Model Evaluation:
Assess model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

Validate the models on test data.

Visualization and Reporting:
Create visualizations to present findings and insights.

Develop a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis and model results.

## Tools and Technologies
Python: For data analysis and modeling.

Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Conclusion
This project provides Walmart with a complete study of their sales data, allowing them to better understand important patterns and factors that influence sales. Walmart's predictive analytics will allow it to more correctly forecast demand, decreasing stockouts and enhancing the satisfaction of customers.
